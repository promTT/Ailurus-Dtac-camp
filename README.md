This is a website application prototype. This website's string will change to a random line. The goal of this website is for visitors to enter a negative message and have it transformed into positive art. When the user is having a bad day, this will heal them by looking at the art work that they have been created. this work is a part of a [Dtac Young Safe Internet Leaders Cyber Camp](https://www.safeinternetlab.com/challenge/camp)
